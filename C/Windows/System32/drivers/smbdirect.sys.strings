The network adapter '%1' does not support a value of %4 for setting %2\%3. The closest adapter supported value of %5 will be used.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per RDMA read request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per RDMA read request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per receive queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per receive queue work request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per send queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per send queue work request.
The SMB Direct Connection performance counter set consists of counters that measure connection activity. A computer can have multiple SMB Direct connections. The SMB Direct Connection counter set represents each connection as a pair of IP addresses and ports, where the first IP address/port represents the connection's local endpoint and the second IP address/port represents the connection's remote endpoint.
